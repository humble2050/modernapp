10. User: Now I wish to display tiles on the each app page e.g. on http://localhost:3003/itam it should display tiles for source, host, target. If I click source - it should display data from https://isro.vercel.app/api/spacecrafts in a table format. Use the same data for now for all the tiles (for development purpose). Each tile should have it's endpoint e.g. /itam/source. When hit back it should take me back to the app page.  
11. User: Apply nice css to all the pages. Including the table data
12. User: Module build failed (from ./node_modules/postcss-loader/dist/cjs.js):
